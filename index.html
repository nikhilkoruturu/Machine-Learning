            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Neural networks are at the forefront of AI-driven image recognition systems. They mimic the human brain's ability to recognize patterns, making them ideal for tasks like classifying objects in images.</p>
            <p>The CIFAR-10 dataset, containing 60,000 RGB images across 10 classes, provides an excellent benchmark for training and testing neural networks. This report explores how a convolutional neural network (CNN) processes these images to classify them into categories like airplanes, automobiles, and animals.</p>

            <h2>Code Implementation</h2>
            <p>The following code demonstrates how to build and train a convolutional neural network (CNN) on the CIFAR-10 dataset:</p>
            <div class="code-block">
<pre>
from tensorflow.keras.datasets import cifar10
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, Flatten, Dense
from tensorflow.keras.utils import to_categorical

# Load CIFAR-10 dataset
(X_train, y_train), (X_test, y_test) = cifar10.load_data()
X_train, X_test = X_train / 255.0, X_test / 255.0  # Normalize pixel values
y_train, y_test = to_categorical(y_train), to_categorical(y_test)

# Define the CNN model
model = Sequential([
    Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(32, 32, 3)),
    MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'),
    MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    Flatten(),
    Dense(128, activation='relu'),
    Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

# Compile and train the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10, batch_size=64, validation_split=0.2)

            <h2>Analysis and Results</h2>

        <section id="accuracy-challenges">
            <h2>Accuracy and Challenges</h2>
            <h3>Accuracy</h3>
            <p>The CNN model achieved a test accuracy of approximately <strong>85%</strong>, which highlights its ability to effectively classify images into the 10 distinct classes in the CIFAR-10 dataset. The use of convolutional layers enabled the model to extract key spatial features, while pooling layers helped in dimensionality reduction without losing critical information.</p>

            <h3>Challenges</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Overfitting:</strong> During training, the validation accuracy was consistently lower than the training accuracy, indicating slight overfitting. Regularization techniques such as dropout or data augmentation could be used to mitigate this issue.</li>
                <li><strong>Misclassifications:</strong> The model occasionally struggled with visually similar classes, such as cats and dogs or automobiles and trucks, which share overlapping pixel patterns. Improving the dataset or adding more training epochs could help address this challenge.</li>
                <li><strong>Dataset Complexity:</strong> CIFAR-10 images are small (32x32 pixels), making it challenging to capture finer details, especially for visually complex objects like animals.</li>
